# dnnComm: unsupervised deep learning for communication signals with different modulations and SNR's

Detail:

- I/Q phase space is embeded to a new dimention by an autoencoder which considers time-lags for signal trajectories in phase space.
- An experiment using embeded data and SVM has been done to see the AUC curve and if the new dimention introduces strong discriminative feature.
